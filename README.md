# Admin Dashboard

#### CHALLENGES FACED DURING PROJECTS

1. I faced significant hurdle styling the sidebar as this was developed using a library called `react-pro-sidebar`. I challenged myself by using the latest version of the library. By using the components of the library, I had significant challenges overriding the default styling of the menuItem and how to handle collapsing of the sidebar. This was solved by reading and making sense of the document to learn about the props available by the component to style the different components of the sidebar. However, It remains a problem changing background of a menu item upon hovering or selecting it. To deal with this issue, I hopped into my browser to target the class on the menu item to override the style to a custom design suitable for the app.
